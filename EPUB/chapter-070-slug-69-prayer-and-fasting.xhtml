				<div><!-- pb_fixme --> <ol class="ch69"><li class="no-indent"><a id="69"></a>When great and notable calamities come upon or threaten the church, community, or nation, when judgment is deserved because of sin, when the people seek some special blessing from the Lord, or when a pastor is to be ordained or installed, it is fitting that the people of God engage in times of solemn prayer and fasting.</li> <li class="no-indent">Prayer and fasting may be observed by private individuals and families at their discretion or by the Church at the discretion of the appropriate judicatory. If the civil authority calls for a time of prayer and fasting that the judicatories of the Church deem to be in harmony with the Scriptures, they should consider issuing such a call to their members.</li> <li class="no-indent">Public notice is to be given before the time of prayer and fasting comes, to enable persons to order their temporal affairs so that they can participate.</li> <li class="no-indent">It is especially appropriate on days of prayer and fasting called by the Church that the people of God gather for a time of prayer, the singing of psalms and hymns, and the reading and preaching of the Word of God. Let them lament their distress or unworthiness before the Lord, confess their sins, humbly implore the Lord for deliverance from the judgment present or imminent or for the blessing sought, and commit themselves anew to the faithful service of the Lord their God. It is fitting on such days that Godâ€™s people abstain from food and from such activities as may distract from their solemn engagement in prayer.</li> </ol> <!-- pb_fixme --></div>
