The <em>Confession of Faith</em> and the <em>Larger</em> and <em>Shorter Catechisms</em> of the Westminster Assembly, together with the formularies of government, discipline, and worship, are accepted by Evangel Presbytery as standard expositions of the teachings of Scripture in relation to both faith and practice. Nothing, therefore, ought to be considered by any court as an offense, or admitted as a matter of accusation, which cannot be proved to be such from Scripture, as interpreted in these Standards.</p>

    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">Offenses are either personal or general, private or public; but all of them being sins against God, are therefore grounds of discipline.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">Personal offenses are violations of the divine law, considered in the special relation of wrongs or injuries to particular individuals. General offenses are heresies or immoralities having no such relation, or considered apart from it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">Private offenses are those which are known only to a few persons. Public offenses are those which are notorious.</p>
