        <strong>The Call to Worship</strong>
      </p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">God having summoned His people to assemble in His presence to worship Him on the Lord’s Day, there ought to be a call to the congregation, in God’s own words, to worship Him. He who performs this element serves as God’s representative voice; accordingly, it ordinarily should be performed by a minister of the Word.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">It is fitting that the congregation respond to the call to worship in words of Scripture, or with singing, or with prayer, or with all of these.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">
        <strong>The Public Reading of God’s Word</strong>
      </p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Because the hearing of God’s Word is a means of grace, the public reading of the Holy Scriptures is an essential element of public worship. He who performs this serves as God’s representative voice. Thus, it ordinarily should be performed by a minister of the Word. Through this reading, God speaks directly to the congregation in His own words. For this reason, readers other than the pastor should ordinarily refrain from interspersing the reading of God’s Word with human comments. He should use an accurate, faithful translation in the language of the people. In English, translations such as the NASB95, NKJV, and KJV fulfill these requirements. Modern translations that pander to the corruptions of the day, such as minimizing or removing the male semantic meaning components of God’s words, are forbidden. The minister should read clearly and with understanding, and the congregation should attend to the reading with the deepest reverence.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">It is desirable that portions from both the Old and the New Testaments be read each Lord’s Day. It is also well that the law of God be read frequently.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">The public reading of the Scriptures to the congregation is to be distinguished from the unison or antiphonal reading of certain portions of Scripture by the minister and the congregation together. In the former, God addresses His people; in the latter, God’s people address their God, expressing in the words of Scripture their own contrition, adoration, gratitude, and other holy sentiments. The Psalms of Scripture are especially appropriate for this purpose.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">
        <strong>The Preaching of God’s Word</strong>
      </p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">The preaching of the Word, the power of God unto salvation, is of central importance in the public worship of God. It is therefore a matter of supreme importance that the minister preach only the Word of God, not the wisdom of man, and that he handle the Word of God correctly, always setting forth Jesus Christ, the Author and Finisher of our faith. In the sermon, God addresses the congregation by the mouth of His servant, and through His Spirit opens the ears of His people.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">The preacher shall prepare each sermon prayerfully and diligently. He must take pains to expound a particular text of Scripture, bringing in other texts as applicable, carefully explaining the meaning, and diligently applying the particular text(s) for the salvation and edification of his hearers. He should take care in preaching that his exposition and application of the Scriptures be clear and simple, having regard to the capacity of the hearers, in demonstration of the Spirit and power, with fervor and zeal, and that he not divorce Christian duty from Christian faith. The preacher must, as Christ’s ambassador, seek to build up the saints in the most holy faith and beseech the unconverted to be reconciled to God. Nothing is more necessary than that the Gospel of salvation by grace be proclaimed without any adulteration or compromise, in order that the hearers may learn to rely for salvation only on the grace of God in Christ, to the exclusion of their own works or character, ascribing all glory to God alone for their salvation. The preacher is to instruct his hearers in the whole counsel of God, exhort the congregation to more perfect obedience to Christ, and warn them of the sins and dangers that are around them and within them. A preacher fails to perform his task as a God-appointed watchman on Zion’s walls when he neglects to warn the congregation of prevalent soul-destroying teachings by enemies of the Gospel.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">The session is to give diligence that no person enter the pulpit concerning whose soundness in doctrine and life, or knowledge of Scripture, there is reasonable doubt.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">No person shall be invited to preach in any of the churches under our care without the consent of the Session, unless sent by the Presbytery.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">
        <strong>The Sacraments</strong>
      </p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">The sacraments, baptism and the Lord’s Supper, as visible signs and seals of the Word of the covenant, are important elements of public worship. They represent Christ and His benefits, confirm His people’s participation in Him, visibly mark off from the world those who belong to His church, and solemnly bind them to covenant faith and loyalty.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Because the sacraments are ordinances of Christ for the benefit of the visible church, they are to be administered only under the oversight of the government of the church. Moreover, in ordinary circumstances they are properly administered only in a gathering of the congregation for the public worship of God, baptism being a sacrament whereby the parties baptized are solemnly admitted into the visible church, and the Lord’s Supper signifying and sealing the communion of believers with Christ and with each other as members of His mystical body.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Although the efficacy of the sacraments does not depend upon the piety or intention of the person administering them, they are not to be administered by any private person, but only a minister of the Word. Because the sacraments were given from Christ through the apostles to the church,<a class="footnote" title="Matthew 28:16-20; 1 Corinthians 11:23." id="return-footnote-189-1" href="#footnote-189-1"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a> and ministers are “stewards of the mysteries of God”<a class="footnote" title="1 Corinthians 4:1." id="return-footnote-189-2" href="#footnote-189-2"><sup class="footnote">[2]</sup></a> in Christ’s church, no other is permitted to take this honor to himself.<a class="footnote" title="Hebrews 5:4." id="return-footnote-189-3" href="#footnote-189-3"><sup class="footnote">[3]</sup></a></p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">
        <strong>Blessings</strong>
      </p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">The salutation and the benediction are blessings pronounced in God’s name and in His own words. Accordingly, they are properly used only in a gathering of Christ’s church and by a minister of the Word.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">A salutation is the greeting from God to His people who have gathered to worship Him. It is fittingly pronounced immediately before or after the call to worship. Words of salutation from Scripture may be used, such as the opening greeting from one of the New Testament epistles, “Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">A benediction is the pronouncement of God’s blessing upon His people at the conclusion of the worship service. Words of benediction taken from Scripture are to be used. The high priestly benediction, “The LORD bless you, and keep you; the LORD make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you; the LORD lift up His countenance on you, and give you peace,”<a class="footnote" title="Numbers 6:24-26." id="return-footnote-189-4" href="#footnote-189-4"><sup class="footnote">[4]</sup></a> or the Trinitarian apostolic benediction, “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all,”<a class="footnote" title="2 Corinthians 13:14." id="return-footnote-189-5" href="#footnote-189-5"><sup class="footnote">[5]</sup></a> are distinctly appropriate. If, however, the minister deems another benediction taken from Scripture more fitting for a particular occasion, he may use it.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="no-indent">B. Those Portions from the People to God</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">
        <strong>Public Prayer</strong>
      </p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Prayer is an essential element of public worship. In order to be accepted by God, prayer is to be by faith, in the name of the Son of God, by the help of His Spirit, and according to God’s will.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">In preparation for the service, the session should provide circumstances conducive to the people adopting an attitude appropriate to worship and prayer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">He who leads in public prayer serves as the voice of the congregation. For this reason, he should pray in such a way, in clear words and in the plural, that the entire assembly of God’s people can pray with him; and it is the duty of the members of the congregation, not only to hear his words, but also to pray them in their hearts. To these ends, he who leads should diligently prepare himself for public prayers, so that he may perform this duty with propriety and with profit to the worshipers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">It is particularly appropriate that public prayer be led by a pastor of the congregation, because in it he both guides the people in their corporate prayer to God and teaches them how to pray biblically. Accordingly, every minister should, by a thorough acquaintance with the Holy Scriptures, by the study of the best writings on prayer, by meditation, and by a life of communion with God, endeavor to acquire both the spirit and the skill of prayer, as should ruling elders. When a guest minister is present, it is well that a pastor or ruling elder, as one who knows the congregation, lead in the prayers of intercession.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Near the beginning of the service, there should be a brief prayer of approach to God in response to His call to enter His presence for worship. It may express humble adoration, confess unworthiness and inability to worship aright, seek His merciful acceptance through Jesus Christ, and invoke the gracious working of the Holy Spirit.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">During the service, there should be comprehensive prayer, which may be offered as more than one prayer throughout the worship service. Such prayer should include adoration of God’s perfections, thanksgiving for all His mercies, confession of sin, supplication for forgiveness through the blood of the atonement and for renewal by the Holy Spirit, lamentation in times of distress or crisis, and intercession for the needs of God’s people and others. It is fitting that the congregation intercede for the whole of mankind; for civil rulers; for the church universal; for Christian missions at home and abroad, Christian education, and other Christian activities; for our whole Church; for churches in ties of like faith with us; for the welfare of the local congregation itself, including its officers, its ministries, and its members, pleading for their growth in sanctification and remembering the daily needs and care of the people—the families, the singles, the rising generation, the elderly, the poor, the sick, the dying, the mourning, the erring, and unsaved loved ones; and for whatever else may seem particularly suitable.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">It is fitting that a prayer of confession of sin precede or follow any reading of the law of God to the congregation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">It is appropriate that there be a brief offertory prayer either immediately preceding or immediately following the worship of God with offerings. Such prayer may thank God for His gifts, devote the offering and the worshipers to His service, and invoke His blessing on its use and on those who give.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">It is fitting to pray at the time of the reading and preaching of the Word. Such prayer may petition for the Holy Spirit to grant illumination and to apply the Word preached to the minds, hearts, and lives of the people and give thanks for the Word received. Ordinarily, such prayer should be by the one preaching the Word.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">While public prayer must always be offered with deep humility and holy reverence and be free from vain repetition or display of words, it can be fitting at times for the entire congregation to pray vocally in unison. The form of prayer that our Lord Jesus taught His disciples, commonly called “the Lord’s Prayer,” is particularly appropriate for this use by the congregation. Great care should be taken, however, to guard against allowing this practice to become a mere formula or ritual.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">It is fitting to encourage the congregation to join vocally in a corporate “amen” at the conclusion of a prayer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Our prayers should be addressed to God the Father and concluded in the name of the Son, according to Scripture.<a class="footnote" title="Luke 11:2; John 14:13-14." id="return-footnote-189-6" href="#footnote-189-6"><sup class="footnote">[6]</sup></a></p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">
        <strong>Congregational Singing</strong>
      </p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Congregational singing is a duty and privilege and should not be neglected in worship. Let every member of the church take part in this act of worship. God’s people should sing, not merely with the lips, but with understanding and with grace in their hearts, making melody to the Lord.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">As public worship is for the praise and glory of God and the building up of the saints, not for the entertainment of the congregation nor the praise of man, the character of the songs used therein is to befit the nature of God and the purpose of worship.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Congregations do well to sing the metrical versions or other musical settings of the Psalms frequently in public worship. Congregations also do well to sing hymns of praise that respond to the full scope of divine revelation. It is recommended that new songs and Psalm settings be sung along with the familiar hymns of the church.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">In the choice of song for public worship, great care must be taken that all the materials of song are fully in accord with the Scriptures. The words are to be suitable for the worship of God and the tunes are to be appropriate to the meaning of the words and to the occasion of public worship. Care should be taken to the end that the songs chosen will express those specific truths and sentiments which are appropriate at the time of their use in the worship service.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Musical gifts are properly used in public worship to assist the congregation in its worship of God. They may not be used for the praise or applause of men.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">No person may take a prominent part in the leadership of the service unless he is a professing Christian who is a member of Christ’s church.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">
        <strong>Public Confession of Faith</strong>
      </p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Individual believers are to publicly profess their faith in Christ before God and His people in order formally to pledge their commitment to serve Christ and to be welcomed into all the privileges of full communion with God’s people.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">It is also fitting that the congregation as one body confess its common faith, using creeds that are true to the Word of God, such as the Apostles’ Creed or the Nicene Creed.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">
        <strong>The Bringing of Offerings</strong>
      </p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">The bringing of offerings in the public assembly of God’s people on the Lord’s Day is a solemn act of worship to almighty God. The people of God are to set aside to Him the firstfruits of their labors; in so doing, they should present themselves with thanksgiving as a living sacrifice to God. All should participate in this act of worship when God gives opportunity for it. Parents are to instruct and encourage their children by precept and example to give of their substance regularly, purposefully, generously, and joyfully to the Lord through His church.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">It is the duty of the pastor, since he is to proclaim to the people the whole counsel of God, to cultivate biblical stewardship and the grace of liberal giving in the members of the church. The pastor himself, as well as the officers of the church, should be exemplary in their own worship through tithes and offerings. The Pastor should remind the church of the admonition in Scripture that everyone is to give as the Lord has prospered him, of the assurance of Scripture that God loves a cheerful giver, and of the blessed example of the Lord Jesus Christ, who, though He was rich, became poor, in order that poor sinners through His poverty might become rich.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">The session shall take care that the tithes and offerings of the congregation are used only for biblical purposes, such as the maintenance of public worship, the preaching of the Gospel throughout the world, the ministry of mercy in Christ’s name, and other Christian objects.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">It is desirable that Christian love be demonstrated by offerings for the use of the deacons in the ministry of mercy on behalf of the church. It is appropriate that a special offering be received for this purpose following the Lord’s Supper.</p>
