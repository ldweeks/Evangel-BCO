    <li class="no-indent"><a id="2"/>Jesus Christ, upon whose shoulders the government is, whose name is called Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace; of the increase of whose government and peace there shall be no end; who sits upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth, even for ever; having all power given unto him in heaven and in earth by the Father, who raised him from the dead, and set him on his own right hand, far above all principality and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come, and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the Head over all things to the Church, which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all; he, being ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things, received gifts for his Church, and gave all officers necessary for the edification of his Church and the perfecting of his saints.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">Jesus, the Mediator, the sole Priest, Prophet, King, Saviour, and Head of the Church, contains in himself, by way of eminency, all the offices in his Church, and has many of their names attributed to him in the Scriptures. He is Apostle, Teacher, Pastor, Minister, and Bishop, and the only Lawgiver in Zion. It belongs to his Majesty from his throne of glory, to rule and teach the Church, through his Word and Spirit, by the ministry of men; thus mediately exercising his own authority, and enforcing his own laws, unto the edification and establishment of his kingdom.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">Christ, as King, has given to his Church, officers, oracles and ordinances; and especially has he ordained therein his system of doctrine, government, discipline, and worship; all which are either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced therefrom; and to which things he commands that nothing be added, and that from them naught be taken away.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">Since the ascension of Jesus Christ to heaven, he is present with the Church by his Word and Spirit, and the benefits of all his offices are effectually applied by the Holy Spirit.</li>
