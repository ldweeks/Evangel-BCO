    <li class="no-indent">A church can be organized only by the authority of Presbytery. The Presbytery may proceed with the organization directly, or through a Commission, or through an Evangelist to whom the Presbytery has entrusted the power to organize churches.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">To proceed to organization a church must normally first elect elders and call a pastor, as follows: <ol type="a"><li class="no-indent">When among the members of the congregation to be organized there are men who appear qualified as officers, the Presbytery, or Commission, or Evangelist shall examine these men and present a slate of candidates for election by the congregation.</li><li class="no-indent">The Presbytery, or Commission, or Evangelist shall oversee the election of a pastor according the provisions of BCO <a href="chapter-022-slug-22-the-election-of-pastors.html#22">22</a> to the extent they apply. The congregational meeting to elect a pastor should take place early enough for Presbytery to consider and approve the pastor’s call prior to the service of organization.</li></ol></li>
    <li class="no-indent">In the organization of a church, the procedure shall be as follows: <ol type="a"><li class="no-indent">Testimonials shall be presented to the Presbytery, or to the Commission, or to the Evangelist by such persons as are members of the Church, if there be any, and applicants for admission to the Church on profession of faith in Christ shall, on satisfactory examination, be received.</li><li class="no-indent">These persons shall in the next place be required to enter into covenant, by answering the following question affirmatively, with uplifted hand, namely: “Do you in reliance on God for strength, solemnly promise and covenant that you will walk together as an organized church, on the principles of the faith and order of Evangel Presbytery, and that you will study the purity and harmony of the whole body?”</li><li class="no-indent">The presiding minister shall then say: “I now pronounce and declare that you are constituted a church according to the Word of God and the faith and order of Evangel Presbytery. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.”</li><li class="no-indent">The ordination and installation of the elders and deacons shall then proceed according to the provisions of BCO <a href="chapter-026-slug-26-election-ordination-and-installation-of-ruling-elders-and-deacons.html#26">26</a> to the extent they apply; the ordination and installation of the pastor shall proceed according to the provisions of BCO <a href="chapter-023-slug-23-the-ordination-and-installation-of-ministers.html#23">23</a> to the extent they apply.</li></ol></li>
