    <li class="no-indent"><a id="33"/>The censures which may be inflicted by church courts are admonition, suspension from the Sacraments, excommunication, suspension from office, and deposition from office. The censures of admonition or definite suspension from office shall be administered to an accused who, upon conviction, satisfies the court as to his repentance and makes restitution as is appropriate. Such censure concludes the judicial process. The censures of indefinite suspension or excommunication shall be administered to an accused who, upon conviction, remains impenitent. When a lower censure fails to reclaim the delinquent, it may become the duty of the court to proceed to the infliction of a higher censure.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">Admonition is the formal reproof of an offender by a church court, warning him of his guilt and danger, and exhorting him to be more circumspect and watchful in the future.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">Suspension from Sacraments is the temporary exclusion from those ordinances, and is removed only upon the demonstration of true repentance.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">Excommunication is the excision of an offender from the communion of the Church. This censure is to be inflicted only on account of gross sin or heresy and when the offender shows himself incorrigible and contumacious. The design of this censure is to operate on the offender as a means of reclaiming him, to deliver the Church from the scandal of his offense, and to inspire all with fear by the example of his discipline.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">Deposition is the removal of an officer from his office, and may or may not be accompanied with the infliction of other censure.</li>
