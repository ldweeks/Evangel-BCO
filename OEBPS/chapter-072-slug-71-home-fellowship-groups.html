    <li class="no-indent"><a id="71"/>It is fitting for church members to gather in each other’s homes on the Lord’s Day and other days, eating together, discussing and applying the preaching of God’s Word, studying the Scriptures, singing praises, confessing sins, praying for one another and bearing one another’s burdens.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">Such a gathering is no substitute for the public worship of the local church on the Lord’s Day.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">Officers of the church may lead these groups or leadership may be delegated to other faithful men. Pastors and elders should maintain frequent communication with group leaders, both to ensure that those leaders are leading a holy life, and to be made aware of pastoral needs of those involved in the group.</li>
