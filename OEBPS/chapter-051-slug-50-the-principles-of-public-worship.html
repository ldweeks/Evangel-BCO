  <h2 class="no-indent">A. God’s Institution of Public Worship</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">The living and true God, our triune Creator, has instituted the worship of Himself by all people everywhere in spirit and in truth.</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Because man’s chief end is to glorify God and fully to enjoy Him forever, all of life is to be worshipful. Nevertheless, worship itself consists primarily in specific acts of communion with God.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Only those people whose hearts have been made new through God’s grace by the work of the Holy Spirit can truly worship God.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">While believers are to worship in secret as individuals and in private as families, they are also to worship as churches in assemblies of public worship, which are not carelessly or willfully to be neglected or forsaken. Public worship occurs when God, by His Word and Spirit, through the lawful government of the church, calls His people to assemble to worship Him together.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">In His Word, God has specially appointed one day in seven as a Sabbath to be kept holy to Him. It is the duty of every one to remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. From the beginning of the world to the resurrection of Christ, the Sabbath was the last day of the week, marking the completion of six days of work, anticipating eternal rest in the coming Messiah. By raising Christ from the dead on the first day of the week, God sanctified that day. And from the time of the apostles, the church, accordingly, has kept the first day of the week holy as the Christian Sabbath, the Lord’s Day, and as the day on which it is to assemble for worship. Now each weekly cycle begins with the people of God resting in Christ in the worship of His name, followed by six days of work. The Lord’s Day thus both depicts that the Christian’s rest has already begun in Christ, and anticipates the eternal rest of His sons and daughters in the new heaven and the new earth.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">God’s covenant people are to devote the entire Lord’s Day as holy to the Lord.</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">In order to sanctify the day, it is necessary for them to prepare for its approach. They should attend to their ordinary affairs beforehand, so that they may not be hindered from setting the Sabbath apart to God.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">It is advisable for each individual and family to prepare for communion with God in His public ordinances. Therefore, they ought to do this by reading the Scriptures, by holy meditation, and by prayer, especially for God’s blessing on the ministry of the Word and sacraments.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">They are then to observe a holy rest all the day from their own works, words, and thoughts concerning their everyday employment and recreations, and to devote themselves to delighting in the public and private exercises of communion with God and His people, in showing mercy and doing good in His name, and in works of necessity.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">They shall so order works of necessity on that day that they do not improperly detain others from the public worship of God, nor otherwise hinder them from sanctifying the Sabbath.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">The Lord’s Day is a day of holy convocation, the day on which the Lord calls His people to assemble for public worship. Although it is fitting and proper that the members of Christ’s church assemble for worship on other occasions also, which are left to the discretion of particular sessions, the Lord calls the whole congregation of each local church to the sacred duty and high privilege of assembling for public worship each Lord’s Day. He expressly commands His people to draw near to Him, not forsaking the assembling of themselves together. Therefore, both worship and fellowship are necessary on the Lord’s Day.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="no-indent">B. The Nature of Public Worship</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">An assembly of public worship is not merely a gathering of God’s children with each other, but is, before all else, a meeting of the triune God with His covenant people. In the covenant, God promises His chosen ones that He will dwell among them as their God and they will be His people.</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">The triune God is present in public worship, not only by virtue of the divine omnipresence, but, much more intimately, as the faithful covenant Savior. Through Christ, God’s people have access by one Spirit to the Father.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">In an assembly of public worship, the triune God is not only the One to Whom worship is directed, but also the One Who is active in the worship of the church. Through His public ordinances, the covenant God actively works to engage His people in communion with Himself. In public worship, God communes with His people, and they with Him, in a manner which expresses the close relationships of the Father and His redeemed children, of the Son and His beloved bride, and of the Holy Spirit and the living temple in which He dwells.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Pastors and ruling elders are to endeavor to inculcate in themselves and in the congregation expectations for, attitudes concerning, and behavior during public worship which are appropriate to the glorious fact that public worship is covenantal communion between God and His people in His public ordinances.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">Because Christ is the Mediator of the covenant, no one draws near to God except through Him alone.</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">God’s people enter the Most Holy Place, the heavenly sanctuary, by the redeeming blood of Jesus, by the new and living way opened for them through the curtain, that is, His flesh. They draw near through Him as their Great High Priest, who has not entered a man-made sanctuary but heaven itself, now to appear for them in God’s presence.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Public worship is to be conducted in a manner that plainly expresses conscious reliance upon the mediation and merits of Jesus Christ. To this end, it is well that there be a prayer of confession of sin early in the worship service. It is fitting that the minister, as God’s ambassador, then declare an assurance of God’s grace in Christ, reminding each worshiper that he can have boldness to approach the holy God only through the mediation and merits of Jesus Christ.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">By the Spirit of the exalted Christ, God draws near to His people and they draw near to their God. They come by grace to Mount Zion, the heavenly Jerusalem, joining innumerable angels and all the people of God in joyous and reverent communion with Him.</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">God’s people not only are to come into His presence with a deep sense of awe at the thought of His perfect holiness and their own exceeding sinfulness, but also are to enter into His gates with thanksgiving and into His courts with praise for the great salvation that He has so graciously wrought for them through His only begotten Son and which He applies to them by His Holy Spirit. All are therefore to worship with sincere devotion, reverence, and expectation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Public worship is to be conducted in reliance on the gracious working of the Spirit of the exalted Christ, which alone can make anyone capable of such sincerity, reverence, devotion, awe, expectation, and joy. Hence, from its beginning to its end, public worship should be conducted in that simplicity which manifests dependence on the Spirit of Christ to bless His own ordinances.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Accordingly, the whole congregation should assemble promptly, that all may be present and may join together for the entire worship service. Unless necessary, none should depart until after the benediction. All should refrain from any behavior that would distract other worshipers or detract from their communion with God.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">In public worship, God’s people draw near to their God unitedly as His covenant people, the Body of Christ.</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">For this reason, the covenant children should be present so far as possible, as well as adults. Out-of-service childcare programs, while permissible and in many cases a necessary good, should lead towards and promote a child’s full participation in the service as soon as possible. Because God makes His covenant with believers and their children, it is fitting for households to sit together.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">For the same reason, no favoritism may be shown to any who attend. Nor may any member of the church presume to exalt himself above others as though he were more spiritual, but each shall esteem others better than himself.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">The unity and catholicity<a class="footnote" title="i.e. universal or worldwide" id="return-footnote-187-1" href="#footnote-187-1"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a> of the covenant people are to be manifest in public worship. Accordingly, the service is to be conducted in a manner that enables and expects all the members of the covenant community—male and female, old and young, poor and rich, uneducated and educated, healthy and infirm, people from every tribe, tongue, and nation—to worship together.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Because God’s people worship, not as an aggregation of individuals, but as a congregation of those who are members of one another in Christ, public worship is to be conducted as a corporate activity in which all the members participate as the Body of Christ.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">The triune God assembles His covenant people for public worship in order to manifest and renew their covenant bond with Him and one another. The Holy Spirit engages them and draws them into the Father’s presence as a living sacrifice in Christ. God Himself has fellowship with them, strengthening and guiding them for life in His presence and service in His kingdom.</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Public worship should be conducted in a manner that reflects God’s initiative in the covenant itself, making clear that God establishes and renews his covenant with His people, assuring God’s people of those things which they so easily forget unless Christ crucified is portrayed before their eyes week after week, cultivating the expectation that God Himself meets His people in Christ as the Holy Spirit works through the public ordinances, always keeping central the persons and works of the triune God.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Consequently, it is well that public worship be so conducted that it is apparent that God summons His church to assemble in His presence, that He assures His people of His receiving and cleansing them through Christ the Mediator, that He consecrates them to Himself and His service by His Word, that He communes with them and gives them grace to help in time of need through His means of grace, and that He sends them out to serve with His blessing at the benediction.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">The triune God reveals the way of knowing and worshiping Him in His Word, the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, which is the only infallible rule of faith and practice.</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">The principles of public worship must be derived from the Bible—either as they are expressly set down in Scripture or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture—and from no other source. The purpose of this directory is not contrary to that purpose, as it points us to what Scripture teaches concerning worship. Thus this directory and our confessions are standards always understood to be subordinate to the Word of God.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">God may not be worshiped according to human imaginations or inventions or in any way not prescribed by his Word, nor may the church require her members to participate in elements of worship that God’s Word does not require. Only when the elements of worship are those appointed in God’s Word, and the circumstances and forms of worship are consonant with God’s Word, is there true freedom to know God as He is and to worship Him as He desires to be worshiped.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">The end of public worship is the glory of the triune God. To that end, Christ builds His church by perfecting the saints and adding to its membership such as are being saved—all to the glory of God. To this end, it is right that non-believers participate in worship because of the natural effect of worship and preaching in calling men to faith (1 Cor. 14:24-25).</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Through public worship on the Lord’s Day, God calls His people to serve Him all the days of the week in their every activity, and enables them, whether they eat or drink or whatever they do, to do all to the glory of God.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">God’s people are to be led to engage in all the elements of worship with a single-minded focus on God’s glory and with a humble and dependent expectation that the exalted Lord Jesus Christ Himself will edify them and build His church through His appointed means of grace—all to the glory of God.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="no-indent">C. The Parts of Public Worship</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">Because a service of public worship is in its essence a meeting of the triune God with His chosen people (some of whom have not yet come to faith and repentance), a worship service consists of two principal parts: those elements which are done on behalf of God (through a representative voice) and those elements which are done by the congregation (through their own or a representative voice).</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">By His Spirit working through the ministry of the Word, God addresses His people in the call to worship, in the salutation and benediction, in the reading and preaching of the Word, and in the sacraments.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">His people, enabled by the Holy Spirit, address God in prayer, in song, in offerings, in hearing the Word, in confession, and in receiving and partaking of the sacraments.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">It is advisable that these two parts be interspersed in the service.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">The triune God is not a passive spectator in public worship, but actively works in each element of the service of worship. Neither are the people of God to be passive spectators in public worship, but by faith are to participate actively in each element of the service of worship.</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Public worship should be conducted in a manner that enables and expects God’s people by faith actively to embrace the blessing of the Lord in the salutation and benediction; to pray with him who leads in prayer, so that the prayer being uttered aloud becomes their prayer, joining the one speaking to God in their behalf by saying “amen” with him at the conclusion of his prayer; to attend, in the reading of God’s Word, to what God reveals of Himself, His redeeming actions for them, and His will for their lives; to confess together with all the people the faith of the church; to heed the Word of truth as the sermon is preached and to appropriate it to their lives as God, through His servant, proclaims and applies it; to sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to the praise of God and the edification of one another; to offer their possessions and themselves together as a living sacrifice to the Lord.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Accordingly, it is appropriate that worshipers respond with brief spoken or sung expressions of praise or affirmation such as “hallelujah” or “amen.” The former is a heartfelt declaration that the living God alone is worthy of adoration. The latter grows out of the responsibility of God’s people to affirm solemnly and earnestly the truthfulness of His Word and the permanence of His character. It is especially fitting for the congregation to join in an “amen” at such times as a response to a blessing, a Scripture reading, a psalm or hymn, a confession of faith, or a prayer. When believers sing or say “amen,” they are testifying to their wholehearted agreement with what has been spoken as being in harmony with God’s permanently valid Word.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">The Lord Jesus Christ has not prescribed a set order for public worship and care must be taken to oppose schismatic movements centered around men’s preferences in this matter. It may not be forgotten, however, that there is true liberty only where the rules of God’s Word are observed and the Spirit of the Lord is, so that all things are done decently and in order, and God’s people approach Him with reverence and in the beauty of holiness.While Christ has not prescribed a set order for public worship, this does not mean that it is fitting to ignore proper and scriptural patterns of worship that have been historically observed by the church, particularly in the Reformed tradition. The order of worship should be so structured that there will be a purposeful movement on the part of the congregation from one element of the service to the next. When each act of worship is full of meaning, the order of the elements will assume a coherent, edifying form.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">The session does well to ensure that the public worship assembly space is so arranged as to reflect and reinforce God’s initiative in drawing near to and gathering His people through the ministry of the Word and sacraments. Because the pulpit, baptismal waters, and communion table facilitate the part of worship which is performed on behalf of God, it is fitting that they be positioned so as to draw the focus of the congregation upon the Word and sacraments, and that they be easily accessible and visible to the entire congregation throughout the worship service. Because the Word is primary and the sacraments serve to seal the Word, it is fitting that the pulpit be in the position of prominence.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="no-indent">D. The Oversight and Conduct of Public Worship</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">Public worship is Christian, not only when the worshipers consciously recognize that Christ is the Mediator by Whom alone they can come unto God, but also when they honor the exalted Christ as the living and only Head of the church, Who rules over public worship.</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">He rules over public worship by His Word and Spirit, not only directly, but also through the ministry of officers in their ruling, serving, teaching, and leading His church.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">The exalted Christ thus applies Himself and His benefits to the elect through His Spirit working in human hearts by and with His Word, especially in its public reading, its preaching, its sealing by the sacraments, and as it is received in faith by prayer.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="nonindent no-indent">For this reason:</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">The session is responsible to give immediate oversight to the conduct of public worship in the local church.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Public worship is ordinarily to be led by those who have been ordained to represent the Lord Jesus Christ in the administration of His Word and sacraments. The pastor of the church is ordinarily responsible to plan (or oversee the planning of) and lead public worship.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Men who have been licensed by a presbytery to preach the gospel may plan and conduct worship as probationers in order that the churches may form a better judgment respecting the fitness of those by whom they are to be instructed and governed. They may not, however, pronounce the salutation or the benediction or administer the sacraments.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">When the session deems it fitting, ruling elders and other approved men may lead the congregation in prayer, read the Scriptures to the congregation, lead unison or antiphonal readings of Scripture by the congregation, lead congregational singing, or, on occasion, exhort the congregation as part of public worship. They may not, however, pronounce the salutation or the benediction, or administer the sacraments.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">On occasion, with the approval of the session and under the close supervision of a minister, exceptions may be made for other men (even the young), and especially those being prepared for the gospel ministry in Christ’s church who are either members of the congregation governed by that session or are ministerial interns under that session. They may not, however, pronounce the salutation<a class="footnote" title="A salutation is a greeting from the Lord, taken from the inspired greetings, like those of the Apostle Paul in his epistles. See, Eph. 1:2; Phil. 1:2." id="return-footnote-187-2" href="#footnote-187-2"><sup class="footnote">[2]</sup></a> or the benediction or administer the sacraments.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">The session may choose to delegate leadership of the musical portions of the service to unordained, godly men gifted for that work, serving under the oversight of the pastor.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">No others should take such leadership in overseeing or conducting public worship.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">There are times when it is appropriate for women to participate vocally in a worship service without it being a violation of Scripture’s command for women to remain silent (1 Cor. 14:34). Women should be encouraged to sing, to share prayer requests, to give testimonies of God’s faithfulness, and to pray.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="nonindent no-indent">Only church officers should distribute the elements of the Lord’s Supper because this activity involves the exercise of pastoral authority over the congregation and is a picture of our Heavenly Father’s provision of fathers to feed His flock.</p>
