    <li class="no-indent"><a id="19"/>Those who have been called to office in the Church are to be inducted by the ordination of a court.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">Ordination is the authoritative admission of one duly called to an office in the Church of God, accompanied with fasting, prayer, and the laying on of hands, to which it is proper to add the giving of the right hand of fellowship.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">As every ecclesiastical office, according to the Scriptures, is a special charge, no man shall be ordained unless it be to the performance of a definite work. In other words, a man cannot be ordained without a call.</li>
