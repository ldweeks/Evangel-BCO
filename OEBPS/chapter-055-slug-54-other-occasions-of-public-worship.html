  <!-- pb_fixme -->
  <p class="nonindent"><a id="54"/>Under the gospel, we are commanded to keep no other particular day holy, except the Lord’s Day. Nevertheless, God’s people may observe other occasions of worship as the Lord allows. Such observance is both consonant with Scripture and pastorally appropriate.</p>
  <h2>A. Prayer Meetings</h2>
  <p class="nonindent">Prayer meetings for the purpose of corporate prayer should be held under the direction of the Session. They may be conducted by the Pastor or member of the session. They may also be conducted by other members of the church when so authorized by the session. The exercises appropriate for the prayer meeting are prayer, reading of Scriptures, instruction and exhortation by men. All of the people of the church, young and old, male and female, should be encouraged to pray aloud in public and so have an active part in the prayer meeting.</p>
  <h2>B. Prayer and Fasting</h2>
  <p class="nonindent">1. When great and notable calamities come upon or threaten the church, community, or nation, when judgment is deserved because of sin, when the people seek some special blessing from the Lord, or when a pastor is to be ordained or installed, it is fitting that the people of God engage in times of solemn prayer and fasting.</p>
  <p class="indent">2. Prayer and fasting may be observed by private individuals and families at their discretion or by the Church at the discretion of the appropriate judicatory. If the civil authority calls for a time of prayer and fasting that the judicatories of the Church deem to be in harmony with the Scriptures, they should consider issuing such a call to their members.</p>
  <p class="indent">3. Public notice is to be given before the time of prayer and fasting comes, to enable persons to order their temporal affairs so that they can participate.</p>
  <p class="indent">4. It is especially appropriate on days of prayer and fasting called by the Church that the people of God gather for a time of prayer, the singing of psalms and hymns, and the reading and preaching of the Word of God. Let them lament their distress or unworthiness before the Lord, confess their sins, humbly implore the Lord for deliverance from the judgment present or imminent or for the blessing sought, and commit themselves anew to the faithful service of the Lord their God. It is fitting on such days that God’s people abstain from food and from such activities as may distract from their solemn engagement in prayer.</p>
  <h2>C. Thanksgiving</h2>
  <p class="nonindent">1. When God’s blessings on the church, community, or nation are particularly evident, it is fitting that the people of God engage in special times of thanksgiving.</p>
  <p class="indent">2. Special times of thanksgiving may be observed by private individuals and families at their discretion or by the Church as called by the appropriate judicatory. If the civil authority calls for a time of thanksgiving that the judicatories of the Church deem to be in harmony with the Scriptures, they should consider issuing such a call to their members.</p>
  <p class="indent">3. Public notice is to be given before the day of thanksgiving comes, to enable persons to order their temporal affairs so that they can participate.</p>
  <p class="indent">4. It is especially appropriate on special days of thanksgiving called by the Church that the people of God gather for prayer, testimony to God’s blessings, joyful singing of psalms and hymns, and the reading and preaching of the Word of God. Let them give thanks to God for His goodness to His people and especially for the greatness of His mercies to them in Christ. And let them commit themselves anew to the faithful service of the Lord their God in gratitude for His blessings. It is fitting on such days that God’s people spend the day in expressions of Christian love and charity toward one another, rejoicing more and more in the Lord, as becomes those who make the joy of the Lord their strength. Also, they may feast together before the Lord with joy and thanksgiving.</p>
  <h2>D. Home Fellowship Groups</h2>
  <p class="nonindent">1. It is fitting for church members to gather in each other’s homes on the Lord’s Day and other days, eating together, discussing and applying the preaching of God’s Word, studying the Scriptures, singing praises, confessing sins, praying for one another and bearing one another’s burdens.</p>
  <p class="indent">2. Such a gathering is no substitute for the public worship of the local church on the Lord’s Day.</p>
  <p class="indent">3. Officers of the church may lead these groups or leadership may be delegated to other faithful men. Pastors and elders should maintain frequent communication with group leaders, both to ensure that those leaders are leading a holy life, and to be made aware of pastoral needs of those involved in the group.</p>
  <h2><a id="54.E"/>E. The Solemnization of Marriage</h2>
  <p class="nonindent">1. Marriage is a divine institution though not a sacrament, nor peculiar to the Church of Christ. It is proper that every commonwealth, for the good of society, make laws to regulate marriage, which all citizens are bound to obey insofar as they do not transgress the laws of God (Acts 5:29).</p>
  <p class="indent">2. Christians should marry in the Lord; therefore it is appropriate that their marriage be solemnized by a lawful minister, that special instruction be given them, and suitable prayers offered, when they enter into this relation.</p>
  <p class="indent">3. During the solemnization of the marriage, the three Scriptural purposes of marriage as described by the <em>Westminster Confession of Faith</em> shall be stated: “Marriage was ordained for the mutual help of husband and wife, for the increase of mankind with a legitimate issue, and of the Church with an holy seed; and for preventing of uncleanness.” Additionally, the man is required to vow to love and cherish the woman, and the woman is required to vow to love, cherish, and obey the man.</p>
  <p class="indent">4. Marriage is to be a lifelong, monogamous union between one man and one woman,<a class="footnote" title="For the intended meaning of the words “man” and “woman,” please refer to [BCO 28], particularly section 7." id="return-footnote-195-1" href="#footnote-195-1"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a> in accordance with the Word of God.</p>
  <p class="indent">5. The parties should be of such years of discretion as to be capable of making their own choice; and if they be under age, or live with their parents, the consent of the parents or others, under whose care they are, should be previously obtained, and well proven to the minister before he proceeds to solemnize the marriage.</p>
  <p class="indent">6. Parents should neither compel their children to marry contrary to their will, nor deny their consent without just and significant reasons.</p>
  <p class="indent">7. Marriage and the welfare of civil society cannot be separated. The happiness of families and the credit of Christianity are deeply interested in it. Therefore, the intent to marry should be sufficiently published for objections to the marriage to be registered in a timely way, and for them to be adjudicated.<a class="footnote" title="This requirement is based upon the ancient practice of “publishing the banns.” In Calvin’s Geneva, for example, it was required that the minister publish the banns—that is, announce to the congregation the intent of a couple to marry—for the three Sundays preceding the wedding. This announcement allowed those who objected to the wedding to explain their reasons to the minister. It also taught the congregation about the public and solemn nature of the wedding ceremony. For more on Calvin’s practice, see, Calvin, John, Robert McCune Kingdon, and John Witte. Courtship, Engagement, and Marriage. Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2005." id="return-footnote-195-2" href="#footnote-195-2"><sup class="footnote">[2]</sup></a> Ministers should be careful that they obey the laws of the community to the extent that those laws do not transgress the laws of God as declared by the Constitution of Evangel Presbytery; and that they not destroy the peace and comfort of families, ministers should be assured that, with respect to the parties applying to them, no just objections lie against their marriage.</p>
  <h2>F. The Visitation of the Sick</h2>
  <p class="nonindent">1. The power of the prayer of faith is great, and Christians therefore should pray for the sick at the throne of heavenly grace, and should also seek God’s blessing upon all proper means which are being employed for their recovery. Moreover, when persons are sick, their minister, or some officer of the church, should be notified, that the minister, officers, and members may unite their prayers for the sick. It is the privilege and duty of the pastor to visit the sick and to minister to their physical, mental, and spiritual welfare.</p>
  <p class="indent">2. In view of the varying circumstances of the sick, the minister should use discretion in the performance of this duty. In some circumstances, the minister will be wise to encourage women to visit other women who are sick or in need of care. For those unable to attend services for extended periods of time, the sacraments may be administered to them by a senior pastor or associate pastor only when a subset of the members of the congregation is gathered in their residence. A short exposition of the Word of God should always accompany the application of baptism or the celebration of the Lord’s Supper. Those gathered, and in good standing, should all partake of the Lord’s Supper together.</p>
  <h2>G. Worship in the Home</h2>
  <p class="nonindent">1. In addition to public worship, it is the duty of each person in private, and of every family in private, to worship God.</p>
  <p class="indent">2. Private worship is commanded by our Lord. In this duty everyone, should spend some time in prayer, reading the Scriptures, holy meditation, and serious self-examination.</p>
  <p class="indent">3. Family worship, which should be observed by every family, should consist in prayer, reading the Scriptures, and singing praises, even if briefly.</p>
  <p class="indent">4. Parents should instruct their children in the Word of God, and in the principles of our holy religion. The reading of devotional literature should be encouraged and every proper opportunity for Biblical instruction should be gladly embraced.</p>
  <p class="indent">5. Parents should set an example of piety and consistent living before the family. The Lord’s Day should be sanctified and left free for worship, rest, and works of mercy.</p>
  <p class="indent">6. In the task of Christian education, parents should cooperate with the Church by setting their children an example in regular and punctual attendance at religious instruction provided by the church and services of worship, by assisting them in the preparation of their lessons, and by leading them in the consistent application of the teachings of the Gospel in their daily activities.</p>
