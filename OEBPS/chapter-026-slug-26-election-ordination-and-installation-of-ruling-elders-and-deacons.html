  <ol>
    <li class="no-indent">Every church shall elect men to the offices of ruling elder and deacon in the following manner: At such times as determined by the Session, communicant members of the congregation at least 18 years old may submit names to the Session, keeping in mind that each prospective officer should be an active male member who meets the qualifications set forth in 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1. After the close of the nomination period nominees for the office of ruling elder and/or deacon shall receive instruction in the qualifications and work of the office. Each nominee shall then be examined in: <ol type="a"><li class="no-indent">his Christian experience, especially his personal character and family management (based on the qualifications set out in 1 Timothy 3:1-7 and Titus 1:6-9),</li><li class="no-indent">his knowledge of Bible content,</li><li class="no-indent">his knowledge of the system of doctrine, government, discipline contained in the Constitution of Evangel Presbytery <em>[<a href="chapter-029-slug-29-amending-the-constitution-of-the-church.html#29.1">BCO 29.1</a>]</em>,</li><li class="no-indent">the duties of the office to which he has been nominated, and</li><li class="no-indent">his willingness to give assent to the questions required for ordination. <em>[<a href="#26.5">BCO 26.5</a>]</em></li></ol><p class="nonindent">If the nominee is married, his wife shall be interviewed regarding the above criteria.</p><p class="indent">If there are candidates eligible for the election, the Session shall report to the congregation those eligible, giving at least thirty (30) days prior notice of the time and place of a congregational meeting for elections.</p><p class="indent">If one-fourth (1/4) of the persons entitled to vote shall at any time request the Session to call a congregational meeting for the purpose of electing additional officers, it shall be the duty of the Session to call such a meeting on the above procedure. The number of officers to be elected shall be determined by the congregation after hearing the Sessionâ€™s recommendation.</p></li>
    <li class="no-indent">The pastor is, by virtue of his office, moderator of congregational meetings. If there is no pastor, the Session shall appoint one of their number to call the meeting to order and to preside until the congregation shall elect their presiding officer, who may be a minister or ruling elder of the Evangel Presbytery or any male member of that particular church.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">All communing members at least 18 years old in good and regular standing, but no others, are entitled to vote in the election of church officers in the churches to which they respectively belong. A two-thirds majority vote of those present is required for election.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">The voters being convened, the moderator shall explain the purpose of the meeting and then put the question:Are you now ready to proceed to the election of additional ruling elders (or deacons) from the slate presented?If they declare themselves ready, the election may proceed by private ballot without nomination. In every case a two-thirds majority of all the voters present shall be required to elect.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="no-indent">Ordination and Installation</h2>
  <ol start="5">
    <li class="no-indent"><a id="26.5"/>The day having arrived, and the Session being convened in the presence of the congregation, a sermon shall be preached after which the presiding minister shall state in a concise manner the warrant and nature of the office of ruling elder, or deacon, together with the character proper to be sustained and the duties to be fulfilled. Having done this, he shall propose to the candidate, in the presence of the church, the following questions, namely: <ol type="a"><li class="no-indent">Do you believe the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, as originally given, to be the infallible Word of God, which is the only infallible rule of faith and practice?</li><li class="no-indent">Do you sincerely receive and adopt the Confession of Faith and the Catechisms of this Church, as the system of doctrine taught in the Holy Scriptures; and do you further promise that if at any time you find yourself out of accord with any of the fundamentals of this system of doctrine, you will on your own initiative, make known to your Presbytery the change which has taken place in your views since the assumption of this ordination vow?</li><li class="no-indent">Do you approve of the government and discipline of Evangel Presbytery, as being in conformity with the general principles of biblical polity?</li><li class="no-indent">Do you accept the office of ruling elder (or deacon, as the case may be) in this church, and promise faithfully to perform all the duties thereof, and to endeavor by the grace of God to adorn the profession of the Gospel in your life, and to set a worthy example before the Church of which God has made you an officer?</li><li class="no-indent">Do you promise subjection to your brethren in the Lord?</li><li class="no-indent">Do you promise to strive for the purity, peace, unity and edification of the Church?</li></ol><p class="nonindent no-indent">The ruling elder or deacon elect having answered in the affirmative, the minister shall address to the members of the church the following question:</p><div class="blockquote"><p class="bl_nonindent">Do you, the members of this church, acknowledge and receive this brother as a ruling elder (or deacon), and do you promise to yield him all that honor, encouragement and obedience in the Lord to which his office, according to the Word of God and the Constitution of this Church, entitles him?</p></div><p class="nonindent no-indent">The members of the church having answered this question in the affirmative, the candidate shall then be set apart, with prayer by the minister or any other Session member and the laying on of the hands of the Session, to the office of ruling elder (or deacon). Prayer being ended, the members of the Session (and the deacons, if the case be that of a deacon) shall greet the newly ordained officer with a holy kiss and take him by the hand, saying in words to this effect:</p><div class="blockquote"><p class="bl_nonindent">We give you the right hand of fellowship, to take part in this office with us.</p></div><p class="nonindent no-indent">The minister shall then say:</p><div class="blockquote"><p class="bl_nonindent">I now pronounce and declare that ____________________ has been regularly elected, ordained and installed a ruling elder (or deacon) in this church, agreeable to the Word of God, and according to the Constitution of Evangel Presbytery; and that as such he is entitled to all encouragement, honor and obedience in the Lord: In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</p></div><p class="nonindent no-indent">After which the minister or any other member of the Session shall give to the ruling elder (or deacon) and to the church an exhortation suited to the occasion.</p></li>
    <li class="no-indent">Ordination to the offices of ruling elder or deacon is perpetual; nor can such offices be laid aside at pleasure; nor can any person be degraded from either office but by deposition after regular trial; yet a ruling elder or deacon may have reasons which he deems valid for being released from the active duties of his office. In such a case the Session, after conference with him and careful consideration of the matter, may, if it thinks proper, accept his resignation and dissolve the official relationship which exists between him and the church.The ruling elder or deacon, though chargeable with neither heresy nor immorality, may become unacceptable in his official capacity to a majority of the church which he serves. In such a case the church may take the initiative by a majority vote at a regularly called congregational meeting, and request the Session to dissolve the official relationship between the church and the officer without censure. The Session, after conference with the ruling elder or deacon, and after careful consideration, may use its discretion as to dissolving the official relationship. In either case the Session shall report its action to the congregation. If the Session fails or refuses to report to the congregation within sixty (60) days from the date of the congregational meeting or if the Session reports to the congregation that it declined to dissolve such relationship, then any member or members in good standing may file a complaint against the Session in accordance with the provisions of <em>[<a href="chapter-046-slug-46-complaints.html#46">BCO 46</a>]</em>.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">When a ruling elder or deacon who has been released from his official relation is again elected to his office in the same or another church, he shall be installed after the above form with the omission of ordination.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">When a ruling elder or deacon cannot or does not for a period of one year perform the duties of his office, his official relationship shall be dissolved by the Session and the action reported to the congregation.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">When a deacon or ruling elder by reason of age or infirmity desires to be released from the active duties of the office, he may at his request and with the approval of the Session be designated deacon or elder emeritus. When so designated, he is no longer required to perform the regular duties of his office, but may continue to perform certain of these duties on a voluntary basis, if requested by the Session or a higher court. He may attend Diaconate or Session meetings, if he so desires, and may participate fully in the discussion of any issues, but may not vote.</li>
