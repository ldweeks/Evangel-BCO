  <p class="nonindent no-indent"><a id="63"/>When a person is received into membership on letter of transfer from another Evangel Presbytery congregation, that reception is effective at the time of the action of the session to receive him. Nevertheless, a session may deem it appropriate to welcome that person publicly into the congregation and allow him to give public expression to his faith. If this is done, it shall be made clear to the congregation that the person has already been received by action of the session. Nevertheless, the minister may address him in appropriate words similar to those found below in BCO <a href="chapter-065-slug-64-reception-by-letter-of-transfer-from-another-church-of-like-faith-and-practice.html#64.4">64.4</a>.</p>
