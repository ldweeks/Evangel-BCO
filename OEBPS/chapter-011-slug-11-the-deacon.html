    <li class="no-indent"><a id="11"/>The office of Deacon is set forth in the Scriptures as ordinary and perpetual in the Church. The office is one of sympathy and service, after the example of the Lord Jesus; it expresses also the communion of saints, especially in their helping one another in time of need.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">It is the duty of the Deacons to minister to those who are in need, to the sick, to the friendless, and to any who may be in distress. It is their duty also to develop the grace of liberality in the members of the church, to devise effective methods of collecting the gifts of the people, and to distribute these gifts among the objects to which they are contributed. They shall have the care of the property of the congregation, both real and personal, and shall keep in proper repair the church edifice and other buildings belonging to the congregation. In the discharge of their duties the Deacons are under the supervision and authority of the Session. In a church in which it is impossible for any reason to secure Deacons, the duties of the office shall devolve upon the Ruling Elders.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">To the office of Deacon, which is spiritual in nature, should be chosen men of spiritual character, honest repute, exemplary lives, brotherly spirit, warm sympathies, and sound judgment.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">It is desirable that the Session and the Board of Deacons meet in joint session once a year to confer on matters of common interest. The Deacons of a particular church shall be organized as a Board, of which the Pastor, or an Elder or Pastor of his choosing, shall be an ex officio member. The Board of Deacons shall elect a Chairman to be presented for the approval of the Session. The Board of Deacons shall elect their Secretary. The Board shall meet at least once a quarter, and whenever requested by the Session. The Board of each church shall determine the number necessary for a quorum, subject to the Sessionâ€™s approval. The Board shall keep a record of its proceedings, and of all funds and their distribution, and shall submit its minutes to the Session once a year, and at other times upon request of the Session. It is desirable that the Session and the Board of Deacons meet in joint session once a year to confer on matters of common interest.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">Deacons may properly be appointed by the higher courts to serve on committees, especially as treasurers. It may also be helpful for the Church courts, when devising plans of church finance, to invite wise and consecrated Deacons to their counsels.</li>
