  <p class="nonindent"><a id="68"/>Prayer meetings for the purpose of corporate prayer should be held under the direction of the Session. They may be conducted by the Pastor or member of the session. They may also be conducted by other members of the church when so authorized by the session. The exercises appropriate for the prayer meeting are prayer, reading of Scriptures, instruction and exhortation by men. All of the people of the church, young and old, male and female, should be encouraged to pray aloud in public and so have an active part in the prayer meeting.</p>
