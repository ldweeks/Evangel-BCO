  <!-- pb_fixme -->
  <h2 class="no-indent"><a id="52"/>A. General Provisions</h2>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">1. In order that the sacraments may be observed with discernment and profit, it is imperative that adequate preparation be made prior to their administration. Before observing the sacraments, God’s people ought to meditate on the teaching of the Word of God concerning them, particularly as summarized in the Confession of Faith and Catechisms. It is also advisable that from time to time the preaching include suitable instruction on the sacraments. Moreover, when the sacraments are being celebrated, the minister shall always accompany them by the preaching of the Word, and he shall take especial care in that preaching to proclaim Christ and His benefits, so that God’s people can understand what the sacrament means. In connection with the administration of the sacraments, he shall set forth a summary of the teaching of the Word of God as to their institution, meaning, and nature.</p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">2. Concerning paedo-baptism, the baptism of infants is not to be unduly delayed, but is to be administered as soon as practicable.</p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">3. Concerning credo-baptism, baptism is to be administered as soon as practicable after public profession of faith in Christ.</p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">4. The Lord’s Supper is to be celebrated frequently, but the frequency may be determined by each session as it may judge most conducive to edification.</p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">5. In the administration of the sacraments, the minister shall follow the directions prescribed in this chapter, but, except in the case of the words of the baptismal formula, he is not required to use the exact language of the indented forms (below), which are suggested as appropriate. He may employ these or similar forms, using his own liberty and godly wisdom, as he deems best for the edification of the people.</p>
  <h2 class="no-indent">B. Baptism</h2>
  <h3 class="no-indent">1. The Baptism of Infants</h3>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">
    <strong>a. Prerequisites</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent">For a child to be presented for baptism, at least one parent must be a communing member of the Church, in good standing, normally of the local congregation. In order to present a child for baptism, parents shall make prior arrangements with the session. Before presentation for baptism, the session shall ensure that instruction has been given to the parent(s) as to the nature, privileges, and responsibilities of baptism for the parents and the child. Only parents who are communing members of a church may be permitted to take parental vows. If only one of two parents is a communing member and taking vows, it shall be the duty of the minister to inform the congregation of the situation, including that the one parent is not a member of this congregation and is not taking the vows. In extraordinary circumstances, at the parents’ request, the session may permit the baptism of a child of parents who are communing members of another church which is approved by the session, on behalf of and with the written permission of the governing body of that church. In such a case, the session shall inform the other governing body, in writing, when the baptism has been administered.</p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">
    <strong>b. The Administration of Baptism to Infants</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">
    <strong>(1) The Institution of the Sacrament</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">The minister ought to read the words of the institution of the sacrament of baptism from a passage such as Matthew 28:18-20.</p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">
    <strong>(2) The Meaning and Nature of the Sacrament</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">The minister shall first summarize before the congregation the teaching of the Word of God and the Confession and Catechisms of this church as to the meaning and nature of the sacrament of baptism. In doing so, he may use these or like words:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">The Lord Jesus Christ instituted baptism as a covenant sign and seal for His church. He uses it not only for the solemn admission of the person who is baptized into the visible church, but also to depict and to confirm His ingrafting of that person into Himself and His including that person in the covenant of grace.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">The Lord uses baptism to portray to us that we and our children are conceived and born in sin and need to be cleansed.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">He uses it to witness and seal to us the remission of sins and the bestowal of all the gifts of salvation through union with Christ. Baptism with water signifies and seals cleansing from sin by the blood and the Spirit of Christ, together with our death unto sin and our resurrection unto newness of life by virtue of the death and resurrection of Christ. The time of the outward application of the sign does not necessarily coincide with the inward work of the Holy Spirit which the sign represents and seals to us. Because these gifts of salvation are the gracious provision of the triune God, who is pleased to claim us as His very own, we are baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">In our baptism, the Lord puts His name on us, claims us as His own, and summons us to assume the obligations of the covenant. He calls us to believe in Jesus Christ as our Savior, to renounce the devil, the world, and the flesh, and to walk humbly with our God in devotion to His commandments.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">
    <strong>(3) Exhortation to the Members of the Congregation to Improve Their Baptism</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">Then the minister may exhort the congregation in these or like words:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">As solemn vows are about to be made before you, and baptism is now to be administered, you who are baptized will do well to take this occasion to reflect on your own baptism. Christ has put His name and claim on you. He calls you to be repentant for your sins against your covenant God, to confess your faith before men, and to live in newness of life to God, who sealed His covenant with you by the blood of His own Son.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">
    <strong>(4) The Ground of Baptizing Infants</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">The minister shall then give instruction as to the ground of the baptism of infants. He may use these or like words:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">Although our young children do not yet understand these things, they are nevertheless to be baptized. For God commands that all who are under His covenant of grace be given the sign of the covenant.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">God made the promise of the covenant to believers and to their offspring. In the Old Testament, He declared to Abraham: “I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto you, and to your descendants after you.”<a class="footnote" title="Genesis 17:7." id="return-footnote-191-1" href="#footnote-191-1"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a> For this reason, in the Old Testament, God commanded that covenant infants be given the sign of circumcision.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">The covenant is the same in essence in both the Old and the New Testaments. Indeed, the grace of God for the consolation of believers is even more fully manifested in the New Testament. He declares that “For the promise is for you and your children.”<a class="footnote" title="Acts 2:39." id="return-footnote-191-2" href="#footnote-191-2"><sup class="footnote">[2]</sup></a> He promises, “Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.”<a class="footnote" title="Acts 16:31." id="return-footnote-191-3" href="#footnote-191-3"><sup class="footnote">[3]</sup></a> He affirms that if even one parent is a believer, the children are “holy.”<a class="footnote" title="1 Corinthians 7:14." id="return-footnote-191-4" href="#footnote-191-4"><sup class="footnote">[4]</sup></a> Moreover, our Savior admitted little children into His presence, embracing and blessing them, and saying, “for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.”<a class="footnote" title="Mark 10:14." id="return-footnote-191-5" href="#footnote-191-5"><sup class="footnote">[5]</sup></a></p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">And so, in the New Testament no less than in the Old, the children of believers have an interest in the covenant and a right to the covenant sign and to the outward privileges of the covenant people, the church. In the New Testament, baptism has replaced circumcision as the covenant sign.<a class="footnote" title="Colossians 2:11–12." id="return-footnote-191-6" href="#footnote-191-6"><sup class="footnote">[6]</sup></a> Therefore, by the covenant sign of baptism the children of believers are to be distinguished from the world and solemnly admitted into the visible church.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">
    <strong>(5) The Covenant Commitments of the Parents and the Congregation</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">The minister shall then require the parents to vow publicly their duty as Christian parents to present their children for baptism and to nurture them in the Christian faith, by answering these questions in the affirmative:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">(1) Do you reaffirm your own faith in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">(2) Do you acknowledge your child’s need of the cleansing blood of Jesus Christ, and the renewing grace of the Holy Spirit?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">(3) Do you claim God’s covenant promises in [his/her] behalf and do you look in faith to the Lord Jesus Christ for [his/her] salvation, as you do for your own?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">(4) Do you now unreservedly dedicate your child to God, and promise, in humble reliance upon God’s grace, that you will seek to set before [him/her] a godly example, that you will pray with and for [him/her], that you will teach [him/her] the doctrines of our holy religion, and that you will strive, by all the tools which God has given us, to bring [him/her] up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord?</p>
  </div>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">The minister shall then require the congregation<a class="footnote" title="If the session has permitted the parents' request for the baptism of an infant to take place in another church, the congregation present at the baptism should not take this vow. At a subsequent date, with explanation (especially in exclusively credo-baptistic churches), the vow should be administered to the home congregation." id="return-footnote-191-7" href="#footnote-191-7"><sup class="footnote">[7]</sup></a> to vow publicly their duty to assist the parent(s) in the Christian nurture of the child:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">Do you as a congregation undertake the responsibility of assisting the parents in the Christian nurture of this child? [If so, say, “We do.”]</p>
  </div>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">
    <strong>(6) Prayer</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">The minister shall then pray for the presence and blessing of the triune God, that the grace signified and sealed by baptism may be abundantly realized.</p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">
    <strong>(7) The Baptism</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">Then, calling the child by name, the minister shall say, as he baptizes him with water, without adding any other ceremony:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">[Name of Child], I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">
    <strong>(8) Charge to the Parents</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">It is then fitting that the minister give a charge to the parents in the following or like words:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">Beloved in Christ Jesus, we give thanks to God for this child that He has given you, and for your expressed desire for [him/her] to know the Lord and to follow Him all [his/her] days. Along with the great blessing of the gift of this child have come responsibilities that you have just acknowledged and to which you have solemnly committed yourselves, and I charge you to continue steadfastly in the commitments that you have made today before God and these witnesses, humbly relying upon the grace of God in the diligent use of the means of grace—especially the Word of God, the sacraments, and prayer.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">
    <strong>(9) Prayer</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">The whole service of baptism shall then be concluded with prayer. It is well in such prayer to thank the Lord for His covenant of grace, rejoice that this child has been included, and to ask the Lord to graciously enable him to be a covenant keeper, daily dying to sin and walking in newness of life in Christ.</p>
  <h3 class="no-indent">2. Infant Dedication</h3>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">While infant dedication is not a sacrament, those who hold credo-baptist views may yet wish to present their child before the congregation, thanking God for his safe delivery, asking God’s blessing upon him, and testifying to God’s promises concerning our children. A suggested ceremony for infant dedication can be found in BCO <a href="chapter-056-slug-55-forms-for-particular-worship-services-ceremonies-and-creeds.html#55.E">55.E</a>.</p>
  <h3 class="no-indent">3. <a id="52.B.3"/>The Baptism of Those Professing Faith</h3>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">
    <strong>a. Prerequisites</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">He who seeks to be baptized shall make a public profession of his faith before the congregation prior to the baptism. He shall previously have received instruction in the Christian faith in accordance with the confessional standards of this Church, including instruction as to the meaning of baptism, and have also made before the session of the church a credible profession of faith in Christ according to the provisions of BCO <a href="chapter-054-slug-53-public-reception-of-church-members.html#53.A.3">53.A.3</a>.</p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">
    <strong>b. The Administration of Baptism to Those Professing Faith</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">
    <strong>(1) The Institution of the Sacrament</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">The minister ought to read the words of the institution of the sacrament of baptism from a passage such as Matthew 28:18-20.</p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">
    <strong>(2) The Covenant Commitment of the One Receiving Baptism and the Congregation</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">At the time of the service at which the person is to be baptized, he shall first profess his faith publicly before the assembled congregation. The minister may address him in these or like words:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">Beloved in the Lord Jesus Christ, we thank our God for the grace that was given you, in that our Savior has sought and found you and through faith you have become a partaker of the covenant of grace. We rejoice that in His grace He has brought you to this congregation and given you the desire to profess your faith before us and to unite with us. We ask that you testify before us to the faith that you profess by giving assent to the following questions.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">To this end, the minister shall require the person to profess publicly his Christian faith by answering these questions in the affirmative:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">(1) Do you believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ His only Son our Lord; and in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of life?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">(2) Do you acknowledge yourself to be a sinner in the sight of God, justly deserving His wrath, and without hope apart from His sovereign mercy?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">(3) Do you believe the Bible, consisting of the Old and New Testaments, to be the infallible Word of God, and its doctrine of salvation to be the perfect and only true doctrine of salvation?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">(4) Do you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of God, and Savior of sinners, and do you receive and rest upon Him alone for salvation as He is offered in the Gospel?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">(5) Do you now resolve and promise, in humble reliance upon the grace of the Holy Spirit, that you will endeavor to live as a faithful follower of Christ?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">(6) Do you promise to support the Church in its worship and work to the best of your ability, to submit yourself to its government and discipline, and to strive for its purity and peace?</p>
  </div>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">The minister shall then require the congregation to vow publicly their duty to welcome into Christian fellowship those being baptized:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">Do you, the members of this congregation, welcome this disciple [<em>or</em> these disciples] and promise by your fellowship to strengthen [his/her/their] tie[s] with the household of God? [If so, say, “We do.”]</p>
  </div>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">If the session deems it appropriate, it may also ask him to bear brief testimony to his faith in his own words.</p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">After answers to the above questions in the affirmative, the minister shall proceed to the baptism.</p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">
    <strong>(3) The Meaning and Nature of the Sacrament</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">The minister shall then summarize before the congregation the teaching of the Word of God and the Confession and Catechisms of this church as to the meaning and nature of the sacrament of baptism. He may use these or like words:</p>

  <p class="indent no-indent">Then, calling the person by name, he shall baptize him with water, without any other ceremony, saying:</p>

  <h2 class="no-indent">C. The Lord’s Supper</h2>
  <h3 class="no-indent">1. General Provisions of the Lord’s Supper</h3>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">The Lord’s Supper is to be celebrated frequently, but the frequency may be determined by each session as it judges most conducive to edification. Where the Lord’s Supper is celebrated less frequently, public notice should be given to the congregation, at least the Sabbath before the administration of this ordinance, and either then, or on some day of the week, the people may be instructed in its nature, and urged to make due preparation for it, that all may come in a suitable manner to this holy feast. In accord with the historical practice of the church, the use of a loaf and common cup is commended as a faithful and rich observation of Christ’s commands for His Table. The senior pastor shall administer the Lord’s Supper. If he is unable, an assistant or associate pastor may administer it.</p>
  <h3 class="no-indent">2. The Institution of the Sacrament</h3>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">The minister shall read the words of the institution and instruction of the Lord’s Supper as found in 1 Corinthians 11:23-29 or one of the Gospel accounts (Matthew 26:26-29, Mark 14:22-25, or Luke 22:14-20). In addition, he may read words of instruction from passages such as John 6 and 1 Corinthians 10.</p>
  <h3 class="no-indent">3. The Meaning and Nature of the Sacrament</h3>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">The minister shall then summarize before the congregation the teaching of the Word of God as to the meaning and nature of the sacrament in the following or like words:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">Our Lord Jesus Christ instituted the Lord’s Supper as an ordinance to be observed by His church until He comes again. It is not a re-sacrificing of Christ, but is a remembrance of the once-for-all sacrifice of Himself in His death for our sins. Nor is it a mere memorial to Christ’s sacrifice. It is a means of grace by which God feeds us with the crucified, resurrected, exalted Christ. He does so by His Holy Spirit and through faith. Thus He strengthens us in our warfare against sin and in our endeavors to serve Him in holiness. The sacrament further signifies and seals the forgiveness of our sin and our nourishment and growth in Christ. The bread and wine represent the crucified body and the shed blood of the Savior, which He gave for His people. In this sacrament, God confirms that He is faithful and true to fulfill the promises of His covenant, and He calls us to deeper gratitude for our salvation, to renewed consecration, and to more faithful obedience. The Supper is also a bond and pledge of the communion that believers have with Him and with each other as members of His body. As Scripture says, “Since there is one bread, we who are many are one body; for we all partake of the one bread.”<a class="footnote" title="1 Corinthians 10:17." id="return-footnote-191-8" href="#footnote-191-8"><sup class="footnote">[8]</sup></a> The Supper anticipates the consummation of the ages, when Christ returns to gather all His redeemed people at the glorious wedding feast of the Lamb. As we come to the Lord’s Table, we humbly resolve to deny ourselves, to crucify the sin that is within us, to resist the devil, and to follow Christ as becomes those who bear His name.</p>
  </div>
  <h3 class="no-indent">4. Invitation and Fencing the Table</h3>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">The minister shall then declare who may come to, and who are excluded from, the Lord’s Table according to the Word of God. He may use the following or like words:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">We have heard, my brothers, how our Lord administered His Supper among His disciples, and in this He shows us that strangers, that is, those not of the company of the faithful should not be admitted. Following this rule, therefore, in the name and by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, I excommunicate all idolaters, blasphemers, despisers of God, heretics, and all who form separate parties to break the unity of the church, all perjurers, all those who rebel against their father and mother and against their superiors, all fomenters of sedition or mutiny, quarrelers, fighters, adulterers, fornicators, sexual deviants, thieves, lovers of money, plunderers, drunkards, gluttons, and all those who lead a scandalous life; declaring to those that they are to abstain from this holy table lest they pollute and contaminate this sacred food, which our Lord Jesus Christ gives only to His servants and faithful ones.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">Therefore, according to the exhortation of the Apostle Paul, let each one test and examine his own conscience, to know whether he truly repents of his faults and is sorry for them, desiring from now on to live in holiness and in conformity with God; and above all, whether he trusts in the mercy of God and seeks his salvation wholly from Jesus Christ; and whether renouncing all hostility and malice, he has the good intention and the courage to live in harmony and brotherly love with his neighbors.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">If we have such a testimony in our hearts before God, let us not doubt in the least that He acknowledges us to be His children and that the Lord Jesus is speaking to us, bringing us to His table and offering us this Holy Sacrament, which He delivered to His disciples.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">And since we are conscious of much frailty and misery in ourselves, as well as not having a perfect faith, but that we are prone rather to unbelief and distrust, so that we are not entirely dedicated to serving God and with such a zeal as we ought, but we have instead a battle daily against the lusts of our flesh; nevertheless, since our Lord has granted us this grace of having His Gospel engraved on our heart, so that we might resist all unbelief, and He has given us the desire and longing to renounce our own desires to pursue His righteousness and holy commandments; let us all be assured that the sins and imperfections that are in us will not prevent Him from receiving us, nor from making us worthy to share in this spiritual table. For we do not come insisting that we are perfect or righteous in ourselves, but rather, seeking our life in Jesus Christ, we confess that we are dead. Let us understand, therefore, that this Sacrament is a medicine for poor, spiritually sick people and that the only worthiness that our Lord requires of us is to know ourselves well enough to be displeased with our sins and to find all our pleasure, joy, and contentment in Him alone.<a class="footnote" title="From John Calvin’s Lord’s Supper liturgy, 1542, 1566, modernized. See Mark Earngey and Jonathan Gibson, Reformation Worship (New Growth Press, 2018), 326–27." id="return-footnote-191-9" href="#footnote-191-9"><sup class="footnote">[9]</sup></a></p>
  </div>
  <h3 class="no-indent">5. Exhortation</h3>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">If desired, the minister may exhort the people of God, in the following or other words, to embrace in the sign the thing that is signified:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">So let us first believe in these promises, which Jesus Christ, who is the infallible truth, spoke with His mouth, namely, that He truly wishes to make us partakers of His body and blood; that we might possess Him fully, so that He might live in us and we in Him. And since we see only bread and wine, yet we do not doubt that He accomplishes spiritually in our souls all that He demonstrates to us outwardly through these visible signs, namely, that He is the heavenly bread that feeds and nourishes us for eternal life. So let us be grateful for the infinite goodness of our Savior, who spreads out all His riches and goods on this table to distribute them to us. For by giving Himself to us, He testifies to us that all He has is ours. Therefore, let us receive this Sacrament as a seal that the power of His death and passion is imputed to us for righteousness, just as though we had suffered it ourselves. Let us therefore not be so wicked as to pull back from where Jesus Christ so gently invites us through His Word. But considering the worth of this precious gift which He has given us, let us present ourselves to Him with ardent zeal, so that He would make us able to receive it.<a class="footnote" title="Ibid., 327–28." id="return-footnote-191-10" href="#footnote-191-10"><sup class="footnote">[10]</sup></a></p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">Beloved congregation, lift up your hearts from these visible elements even to heaven itself, where Jesus Christ is seated at the right hand of the Father, from where we look for Him to return and perfect our redemption. All the promises of God are yes and amen in Him. Every spiritual blessing is found in Him. With joyful hearts, in Christian love, partake of His Table, giving thanks for the great love that He has shown to us.</p>
  </div>
  <h3 class="no-indent">6. Prayer</h3>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">The distribution of the elements shall be preceded by prayer. It is well in such prayer to praise God for His mighty power and grace in bringing salvation; confess our unworthiness to come to the Table because of our own utter lack of righteousness; reaffirm our trust in God’s grace and in Christ’s righteousness and mediation; plead for the Lord to grant the gracious, effectual working of His Spirit in us; thank God for the elements, request Him to use them for their intended purpose; and ask Him to grant that by faith His people may feed upon Jesus Christ, crucified and raised for them, so that, being strengthened by grace, they might live in Him and for Him.</p>
  <h3 class="no-indent">7. Partaking of the Elements</h3>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">Normally,<a class="footnote" title="This portion of the Lord’s Supper liturgy follows the historical Reformed liturgies of the early Reformation. With the addition of the word “normally,” we do not intend to allow significant departure from this process of partaking of the elements. Intinction—the taking of the elements simultaneously by communicants—or the use of many individual cups does not significantly depart from the outlined process. The significance of both the bread and the cup should be described prior to eating and drinking." id="return-footnote-191-11" href="#footnote-191-11"><sup class="footnote">[11]</sup></a> the elements of the Lord’s Supper should be taken in the following manner.</p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">After prayer and thanksgiving, the minister shall take the bread, saying in the following or like words:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">Our Lord Jesus Christ, the same night in which He was betrayed, took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to His disciples, as I, ministering in His name, give this bread to you.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">The minister shall then break the bread and give it to the people; it shall be distributed to the people by church officers, preferably the ruling elders, but in any case male officers. The bread may be eaten either upon reception of it, or in unison when all have been served, as the session may judge most conducive to edification. The minister may continue, before the bread is eaten, saying:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">Our Lord Jesus said, “Take, eat, this is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”</p>
  </div>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">Having given the bread, the minister shall take the cup and give it to the people, saying in the following or like words:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">In the same manner, our Savior also took the cup, and having given thanks as has been done in His name, He gave it to His disciples, as I ministering in His name give this cup to you.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">The minister shall then give the cup, as in the distribution of the bread; it shall be distributed to the people by church officers, preferably the ruling elders, but in any case male officers. The minister may continue, before the cup is drunk, saying:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">Our Lord Jesus said, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is shed for many for the remission of sins; drink of it, all of you.”</p>
  </div>
  <h3 class="no-indent">8. Response of Thanksgiving and Commitment</h3>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">When all have partaken, prayer or a congregational song should be offered. It is well in such prayer to give thanks for the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, through whom we have the forgiveness of sins; recommit God’s people to Christ and to each other; present them as a living sacrifice to God; and plead that the Holy Spirit will make the sacrament effectual to the edifying and strengthening of God’s people.</p>
  <p class="indent no-indent">It is well that the congregation respond by singing a psalm or hymn that focuses on the benefits of Christ’s death and the triumph of the Gospel, bringing forth gratitude and joy and renewed commitment of the believer to His Lord, and that an offering be taken for the relief of the poor or for some other sacred purpose.</p>
  <h3 class="no-indent">9. Blessing</h3>
  <p class="nonindent no-indent">The following benediction is particularly appropriate when the Lord’s Supper has been celebrated:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">“Now the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the eternal covenant, even Jesus our Lord, equip you in every good thing to do His will, working in us that which is pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.”<a class="footnote" title="Hebrews 13:20-21." id="return-footnote-191-12" href="#footnote-191-12"><sup class="footnote">[12]</sup></a></p>
