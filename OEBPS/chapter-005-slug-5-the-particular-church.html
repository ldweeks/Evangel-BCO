    <li class="no-indent"><a id="5"/>A particular church consists of a number of professing Christians, with their children, associated together for divine worship and godly living, agreeably to the Scriptures, and submitting to the lawful government of Christ’s Kingdom.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">Its officers are the Pastor(s), the Ruling Elders, and the Deacons.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">Its jurisdiction being a joint power, is lodged in the hands of the church Session, consisting of the Pastor(s) and Ruling Elders.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">To the Deacons belong the collection and administration of the offerings of the people for the relief of those in need, and for the work of the church, under the supervision of the Session.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">The ordinances established by Christ, the Head, in His Church, are prayer; singing praises; reading, expounding and preaching the Word of God; administering the sacraments of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper; public solemn fasting and thanksgiving; catechising; making offerings for the relief of the poor and for other pious uses; exercising discipline; the taking of solemn vows; and the ordination to sacred office.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">Churches destitute of the official ministration of the Word ought not to forsake the assembling of themselves together, but should be convened by the Session on the Lord’s Day, and at other suitable times, for prayer, praise, the reading and expounding of the Holy Scriptures, and exhortation, or the reading of a sermon of some approved minister. In like manner, Christians whose lot is cast in destitute regions ought to meet regularly for the worship of God.</li>
