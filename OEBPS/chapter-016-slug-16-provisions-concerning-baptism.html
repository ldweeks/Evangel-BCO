    <li class="no-indent">“Being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace” (Eph. 4:3), the members and churches of the Presbytery are committed to the formal communion of Christians who hold differing convictions concerning time and mode of baptism. As to time, credo-baptists believe the sacrament of baptism should be administered only to those making a credible profession of faith; paedo-baptists believe it should be administered to those making a credible profession of faith and to their infant children. Though recognizing that only one of the two positions is Scriptural, the members and churches of the Presbytery agree Christians should have freedom of conscience with respect to time and mode of baptism and not divide over it. To that end, both credo-baptists and paedo-baptists should pursue the blessings of co-laboring and fellowship with one another under mutual accountability and love, persuaded these blessings flow from “one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all” (Eph. 4:5).</li>
    <li class="no-indent">A person seeking membership in any church of the presbytery will enjoy freedom of conscience concerning time and mode of baptism. Membership in a church is open equally to the credo-baptist and paedo-baptist.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">True unity is possible only through true charity that respects a church’s existing commitments on baptism and takes care to avoid unnecessary offense. For example, a church historically committed to credo-baptism is not required to administer baptism to the infant of a believing member. Nor is a church historically committed to paedo-baptism required to perform the ceremony of infant dedication. Nothing in this paragraph forbids a church from changing its historical position concerning the time and mode of baptism, nor its openness to performing baptisms and dedications of infants as seems best to it at the present time. Nevertheless, every church is under obligation to continue to observe the conscience protections set forth in this chapter.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">A particular church must declare her intent to the Presbytery to be only paedo-baptist or only credo-baptist, or both, in local polity and practice. If a church changes her polity and practice in this regard, she must inform the Presbytery of the change.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">A paedo-baptist parent who holds membership in a church historically committed to credo-baptism may request a church recognizing paedo-baptism to administer baptism to his infant. In the same way, a credo-baptist parent who holds membership in a church historically committed to paedo-baptism may request a church recognizing credo-baptism to perform the ceremony of infant dedication.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">The children of communing believers are non-communing members, though only in the strict and distinct sense as set forth in <em>[<a href="chapter-007-slug-7-church-members.html#7">BCO 7</a>]</em>. A church’s membership roll shall include the children of communing members in a separate list, identifying them as non-communing members. However, membership shall be understood to conform to the convictions of the church and parents concerning infant baptism and shall not imply a status that overrides those convictions. This unity is possible because the church and parents understand the child is a proper recipient of the church’s care, love, discipline, and training, with a view to his embracing Christ and thus possessing personally all the benefits of the covenant.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">A person baptized as an infant but pursuing communicant membership in a credo-baptist church will not be required to submit to a re-baptism as a condition of communicant membership. Nor will a credo-baptist holding membership in a paedo-baptist church be disciplined for neglecting to bring forward his infant child for baptism.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">A church may require its officers to hold to one position or the other concerning time of baptism, or it may allow them freedom of conscience. In other words, a church’s officers may be exclusively credo-baptist, exclusively paedo-baptist, or composed of both credo-baptists and paedo-baptists. Ordinarily, a church’s bylaws will indicate whether officers must be exclusively credo-baptist, exclusively paedo-baptist, or may be composed of both.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">Members of the Presbytery will enjoy freedom of conscience concerning time and mode of baptism. Historical modes of baptism, namely immersion, pouring, and sprinkling, shall be acceptable.</li>
    <li class="no-indent">While freedom of conscience on time and mode of baptism is permitted for the sake of unity, this in no way precludes a Christian layman or officer from trying to persuade others in the church, session, or Presbytery to come to a different conviction. When one is engaged in such teaching or debate, however, he must take care not to attack or undermine the principle of freedom of conscience established in this chapter.</li>
