  <h2><a id="53"/>A. General Provisions</h2>
  <p class="nonindent">1. Only those may be admitted to full communion in the church who have been baptized and have made public profession of faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
  <p class="indent">2. In order to aid those who contemplate making public profession or reaffirmation of faith in Christ to understand the implication of this significant act and to perform it meaningfully, the pastor or someone approved by the session shall conduct classes in Christian doctrine and life, both for the children of the church and for any others who may manifest an interest in the way of salvation.</p>
  <p class="indent"><a id="53.A.3"/>3. In order for the session to assure itself so far as possible that the candidate makes a credible profession, it shall examine him to ascertain that he possesses the knowledge requisite for saving faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, relies on the merits of Christ alone, and is determined by the grace of God to lead a Christian life.</p>
  <p class="indent">4. In the public reception of church members, the minister shall follow the directions prescribed in this chapter, but he is not required to use the exact language of the forms (below), which are suggested as appropriate. He may employ these or similar forms, using his own liberty and godly wisdom as he deems best for the edification of the people.</p>
  <p class="indent">5. Whether baptized or unbaptized, children of communing members are non-communing members of the particular church and come to the Lord’s Table, also, by a credible profession of faith. Normally such professions should be actively sought in the regular course of the elder board’s shepherding work. Because God has limited the ability of infants and very young children to articulate a credible profession of faith, demonstrate the fruit of repentance, and discern the Lord’s body, they do not yet qualify for admission to communicant membership and the Lord’s Table.<a class="footnote" title="Calvin’s process for allowing covenant children to come to the Lord’s Supper is described by Scott Manetsch as follows: “By the time that students completed their studies at the schola privata at age eleven or twelve, they would have worked through Calvin’s Catechism six or seven times and most would have mastered its doctrinal contents. It is important to note, however, that admission to the Lord’s Table was not tied directly to a child’s level of schooling or age. The Ecclesiastical Ordinances made clear that boys and girls were welcomed to the Lord’s Supper only after they had reached the age of discretion (around ten years of age) and were able satisfactorily to articulate the basic doctrines of the reformed religion and confess it as their own. Toward that end, four times a year on the Sunday before Geneva’s quarterly communion service, young people who were prepared to confess their Christian faith stood in front of the worshiping congregation and, in response to the ministers’ questions, recited the shortened form of the Catechism that served as their formal profession of faith. A week later, they were invited for the first time to feed upon the body and blood of Jesus Christ offered in the sacred meal of the Lord’s Table.” Calvin’s Company of Pastors: Pastoral Care and the Emerging Reformed Church, 1536-1609 (Oxford University Press, 2013), 270-71. Additionally: “Another primary source, though, describes the age of discretion and Geneva’s children coming to the Lord’s table as between ages eight and ten: ‘Throughout all this, somebody else reads from the pulpit in the vernacular, with head uncovered, the Gospel of Saint John, from the beginning of the thirteenth chapter, until everyone has taken their pieces, both men and women, each one at their different tables, along with the boys and girls of around eight to ten years of age.’” Ibid., 275, quoting Antoince Cathelan, Passevent Parisien, 74." id="return-footnote-193-1" href="#footnote-193-1"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a> For further explanation, see BCO <a href="chapter-001-slug-1-the-doctrine-of-church-government.html#1.3">1.3</a>.</p>
  <p class="indent">6. If they have been baptized, non-communing members of the congregation may be received into communicant membership by profession of faith.</p>
  <h2><a id="53.b"/>B. Reception into Full Communion of Non-communing Members by Profession of Faith<a class="footnote" title="For children of paedo-baptistic parents making a profession of faith in a credo-baptistic church, please see BCO 53.F.3, 53.F.4." id="return-footnote-193-2" href="#footnote-193-2"><sup class="footnote">[2]</sup></a></h2>
  <p class="nonindent">1. When a non-communing member who was baptized as an infant is received into full communion, that reception is effective at the time of his public profession of faith. On the occasion of that person’s public reception, it is highly advisable that the minister remind the people that he is already a member of the church, albeit a non-communing member, and has been receiving the blessings of Christ as a member of the church, and that those blessings have resulted in this day wherein, having given evidence of conscious saving faith in Christ, he is now about to confess that faith and become a communing member of the congregation. The minister may then address him in these or like words:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">Beloved in the Lord Jesus Christ, we thank our God for the grace that was given you, in that you have accepted God’s covenant promise that was signified and sealed unto you in your infancy by holy baptism. We ask you now to profess your faith publicly.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="nonindent"><a id="53.B.2"/>2. The minister shall then require the person to profess publicly his Christian faith by giving assent to these questions:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">(1) Do you believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ His only Son our Lord; and in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of life?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">(2) Do you acknowledge yourself to be a sinner in the sight of God, justly deserving His wrath, and without hope apart from His sovereign mercy?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">(3) Do you believe the Bible, consisting of the Old and New Testaments, to be the infallible Word of God, and its doctrine of salvation to be the perfect and only true doctrine of salvation?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">(4) Do you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of God, and Savior of sinners, and do you receive and rest upon Him alone for salvation as He is offered in the Gospel?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">(5) Do you now resolve and promise, in humble reliance upon the grace of the Holy Spirit, that you will endeavor to live as a faithful follower of Christ?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">(6) Do you promise to support the Church in its worship and work to the best of your ability, to submit yourself to its government and discipline, and to strive for its purity and peace?</p>
  </div>
  <p class="nonindent">If the session deems it appropriate, it may also ask him to bear brief testimony to his faith in his own words.</p>
  <p class="indent">3. It is appropriate that the minister exhort the congregation in these or like words:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">From the time [Name] was baptized, the whole congregation has been obligated to love and receive [him/her] as a member of the church. As [he/she] is received into full communion, the congregation is reminded of these obligations. For in Christ we are members of one another. Christ claims this [brother/sister] as His own and calls you to receive [him/her] in love and commitment. Therefore, you ought to commit yourself before God to assist [Name] in [his/her] Christian nurture by godly example, prayer, and encouragement in our most precious faith and in the fellowship of believers.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="nonindent">4. When anyone has publicly professed his faith in this way, it is fitting that the minister address him in the following or similar words:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">Beloved, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I welcome you to all the privileges of full communion with God’s people, and in particular to participation in the sacrament of the Holy Supper.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">I charge you to continue steadfastly in the confession that you have made, humbly relying upon the grace of God in the diligent use of the means of grace—especially the Word of God, the sacraments, and prayer.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">Rest assured that if you confess Christ before men, He will confess you before His Father who is in heaven.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">May the God of all grace, who called you unto His eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, perfect, establish, and strengthen you. To Him be the glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="nonindent">This part of the service shall be concluded with prayer.</p>
  <h2><a id="53.c"/>C. Reception by Letter of Transfer from Another Church within Evangel Presbytery.</h2>
  <p class="nonindent">When a person is received into membership on letter of transfer from another Evangel Presbytery congregation, that reception is effective at the time of the action of the session to receive him. Nevertheless, a session may deem it appropriate to welcome that person publicly into the congregation and allow him to give public expression to his faith. If this is done, it shall be made clear to the congregation that the person has already been received by action of the session. Nevertheless, the minister may address him in appropriate words similar to those found below in Section D.4.</p>
  <h2>D. Reception by Letter of Transfer from Another Church of Like Faith and Practice</h2>
  <p class="nonindent">1. When a person is received into membership on letter of transfer from another church of like faith and practice approved by the session, that reception is effective at the time of his public profession of faith. On the occasion of that person’s public reception, the minister shall address him in these or like words:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">Beloved in the Lord Jesus Christ, we thank our God for the grace that was given you, in that you have accepted God’s promise of salvation and publicly confessed your faith in the Savior, Jesus Christ. We praise Him that He brought you into communicant membership in a church of like faith and practice with this congregation. We rejoice that God, in His gracious providence, has now brought you here and given you a desire to unite with us, and that your former church has committed you to our fellowship and oversight. We ask that you testify before us to the faith that you profess by giving assent to the following questions.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="nonindent">2. The minister shall then require the person to profess publicly his Christian faith by giving assent to these questions:</p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">(1) Do you believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ His only Son our Lord; and in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of life?</p>

  <div class="blockquote">
    <p class="bl_nonindent">Beloved in the Lord Jesus Christ, we thank our God for the grace that was given you, in that you have accepted God’s promise of salvation and publicly confessed your faith in the Savior, Jesus Christ.
